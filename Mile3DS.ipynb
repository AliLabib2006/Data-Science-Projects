    "    K-means:\n",
    "    K-Means forms clusters by first choosing the number of clusters (k) and randomly placing k points called centroids. Each data point is assigned to the nearest centroid based on distance. Then, the centroids are moved to the center (mean) of the points in their cluster. This process repeats until the centroids no longer change significantly. In the end, each point belongs to exactly one cluster. K-Means works best for data that forms compact, circular-shaped groups.\n",
    "    Agglomerative Clustering:\n",
    "        Agglomerative clustering is a type of hierarchical clustering. It starts by treating each data point as its own cluster. Then, it repeatedly finds and merges the two closest clusters based on distance until only the desired number of clusters remains. This process creates a tree-like structure (dendrogram) that shows how clusters were merged. It doesn't assume the shape of the clusters and works well for various cluster sizes and forms.\n",
    "    Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM):\n",
    "        GMM assumes that the data comes from a mixture of multiple Gaussian (bell curve) distributions. Each cluster is modeled as a probability distribution with its own mean and shape. Instead of assigning points to a single cluster, GMM gives each point a probability of belonging to each cluster. It uses a method called Expectation-Maximization (EM) to improve the accuracy step by step. This is useful for data where clusters may overlap.\n",
    "    BIRCH Clustering :\n",
    "        BIRCH is designed for very large datasets. It builds a tree-like structure called a CF Tree that groups data into small, compact clusters as it scans the dataset. Once the tree is built, it can optionally use another algorithm like K-Means to refine the final clusters. BIRCH is very fast and memory-efficient, but it may not work as well when clusters have complex shapes or are very close together."

The second group includes older or budget-conscious shoppers who have lower income and spending levels, responding best to discounts, value bundles, and senior-focused promotions. The third cluster represents middle-aged customers with average income and moderate spending habits, forming the stable core of the customer base suitable for general marketing and upselling strategies. The fourth group comprises high-income but low-spending individuals who tend to be selective buyers, making personalized premium services and luxury branding effective engagement tools. Finally, the fifth cluster contains balanced customers with average income and spending patterns; they are loyal but less active, benefiting from broad marketing campaigns and retention incentives.
