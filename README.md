ðŸ“Š Milestone 1 â€“ Data Exploration & Preprocessing
Project Title: Loan Approval Dataset â€“ Data Exploration and Preparation
Dataset: Loan Approval Dataset from Kaggle

Description:
This project focuses on exploring and preparing the Loan Approval dataset for further analysis. Various preprocessing tasks were performed including handling missing values, encoding categorical features, feature scaling, and removing duplicates. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques such as histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, and PCA visualizations were applied to understand feature relationships and data distribution. The project lays the groundwork for classification tasks in later milestones.

ðŸ¤– Milestone 2 â€“ Classification with Machine Learning Models
Project Title: Loan Approval Prediction Using ML Algorithms
Dataset: Loan Approval Dataset from Kaggle

Description:
In this milestone, we built classification models using the preprocessed Loan Approval dataset. Four machine learning algorithmsâ€”K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forestâ€”were implemented to predict loan approval outcomes. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix, and F1-score were used to compare model performance. The results provided insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each model in handling the given classification problem.

ðŸ§© Milestone 3 â€“ Customer Segmentation with Clustering
Project Title: Mall Customers Segmentation Using Clustering Techniques
Dataset: Mall Customers Dataset from Kaggle

Description:
This project applies unsupervised learning to segment mall customers based on their demographic and spending behavior. Using PCA for visualization and the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters, we implemented K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Model, and BIRCH. Each clustering method was evaluated using Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index, and visualized to highlight differences in customer segmentation. The project showcases the application of clustering in real-world customer profiling.
